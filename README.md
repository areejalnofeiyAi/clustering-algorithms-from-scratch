📊 Clustering Project (K-Means & DBSCAN)

📌 Overview:

Implementation of clustering algorithms from scratch to understand how unsupervised learning works internally.

🧠 Algorithms:

K-Means (custom implementation)

DBSCAN (custom implementation)

Euclidean distance calculation

🛠️ Tools:

Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (for dataset generation & evaluation)

🎯 Outcome:

Visualized clusters, evaluated performance using the silhouette score, and analyzed clustering behavior.
